# Minigrid Datasets

By default, level datasets generated using `minigrid_dataset_generation.py` will be saved in this directory.

You can also download datasets from our [dataset repository](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/8808), unzip 
them, and place the resulting folders in this 
directory.

A dataset is saved as a directory containing multiple files:
- `dataset.meta` : metadata file containing information about the dataset
- `batch_X.data`/`test_batch_X.data`: files containing batches of levels from the train or test subsets, encoded as DGL graphs.
- `batch_X.data.meta`/`test_batch_X.data.meta`: metadata files containing information about their corresponding batch files, including each level graph re-encoded as numpy arrays directly compatible with MiniGrid.
- `batch_X.data.dgl.extra`/`test_batch_X.data.dgl.extra`: additional batch metadata encoded as DGL graphs. This metadata is stored separately from the rest of the metadata for storage efficiency reasons.
- `layouts.png`: rendering of sampled levels from the dataset.

Due to its large number of files and its use as a base to generate additional dataset, we also provide the 
`batch_info.csv` file in the `minigrid_dense_graph_1M` dataset available for download. This file groups the batches 
generated by their respective 
task structures in a format that is easily parsable.
